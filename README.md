# Piltaland United States | ピルタランド連合国家

🏛️ **Official GitHub Organization Portal**

A federation of 16 states governed by **Law as Code** principles. All laws, infrastructure standards, and governance are managed through GitHub repositories.

## 🌐 About Piltaland

Piltaland is a fictional federation of 16 autonomous states, inspired by the UAE model. The Federal Unified Government manages wide-area infrastructure (such as railway licenses), while each state maintains its own governance through dedicated repositories.

### Historical Context

Originally an English-speaking region, Piltaland was once governed by an Eastern Empire (Japan). This legacy has deeply embedded Japanese language into our railway terminology and administrative systems, making us a bilingual nation where English and Japanese coexist in official documentation.

### Governance Philosophy

**Law as Code** - All national laws, regulations, and infrastructure specifications are version-controlled in GitHub. Every change goes through:
1. Pull Request submission
2. Community review
3. Federal approval
4. Merge and deployment

## 🗺️ Geography & Demographics

### Major States

| Rank | State | Population | Key Features |
|------|-------|------------|--------------|
| #1 | Vakapmaa | 5,320,000 | Central hub, major cities (Tuuna, Pertvepota) |
| #2 | Napokinmaa | 5,170,000 | Economic powerhouse, private railway network hub |
| #3-16 | Various States | 3-5M each | Each with autonomous governance |

### Geographic Challenge

The **Alps-Veris Mountain Range** (アルプス・ヴェリス山脈) runs north-south through the center of the country (elevation H: 50-100), dividing east and west. This requires sophisticated railway engineering including:
- Loop lines (ループ線)
- Switchbacks (スイッチバック)
- Extensive tunneling (トンネル)

## 🚄 Railway System

### Track Gauges

- **Narrow Gauge (狭軌)**: 1067mm - Legacy system from imperial era
- **Standard Gauge (標準軌)**: 1435mm - Modern Shinkansen (新幹線) system

### Operation Model

**Vertical Separation (上下分離方式)**
- Federal Government owns and maintains track infrastructure
- Public and private operators run train services
- Railway licenses issued through Pull Request system

### For Railway Operators

To apply for a railway license:

1. Fork `/railway-standards`
2. Create your application in `/applications/[your-company-name].md`
3. Include:
   - Proposed route and gauge
   - Technical specifications
   - Safety plan
   - Environmental impact assessment
4. Submit Pull Request with tag `railway-license-application`
5. Engage with Federal Railway Board during review

## 📋 Directory Purposes

### `/laws`
Contains all federal and state laws in markdown format. Each law is version-controlled and changes require Pull Request approval through the legislative process.

### `/railway-standards`
Technical specifications for railway construction and operation:
- Track specifications (1067mm / 1435mm)
- Signal systems
- Safety requirements
- Rolling stock standards
- Tunnel and bridge specifications for Alps-Veris crossings

### `/map-data`
Geographic information system data:
- Topographical data
- Railway route maps
- State boundaries
- Infrastructure locations
- GeoJSON format for interoperability

## 🏛️ Federal vs. State Authority

### Federal Unified Government (連邦統一政府) Controls:
- Railway licensing and standards
- Interstate infrastructure
- Federal laws and regulations
- Cross-state coordination

### Individual States Control:
- Local governance (via state repositories)
- Intra-state regulations
- Local infrastructure
- State-specific policies
